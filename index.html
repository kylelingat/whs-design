                            <p></p>



                            Thank you for your patience and understanding. The problem has been corrected and phones calls can be made into the school. <br>
                            <p></p>





                            There is an issue with outside calls getting a message that they are reaching a non-working number when calling any school within the Waipahu complex. This is due to an issue with our Cisco phones services. <br>
                            <p></p>



                            We apologize to those of you trying to make contact with members of our school community. Please use an alternate form (email) to conduct business until we can have the issue resolved. An update will be posted once the problem has been taken care of.
                            <br>
                            <p></p>

                            This has been reported to our tech support and will hopefully be resolved soon. Thank you for your patience and understanding. </p>
